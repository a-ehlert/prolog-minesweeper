Prolog Minesweeper with some AI assistance



How to play

To start a preset game mode, type ‘play(mini).’, ‘play(easy).’, ‘play(normal).’ or ‘play(hard).’. Instructions will follow. To start a custom game, type play(H,W,N) where H, W, N are the Height, Width, and Number of mines respectively. For example, play(easy) is equivalent to play(8,8,10).


Notes

I recommend you run this in SICStus Prolog, as SWI-Prolog seems to run out of stack. May be due to default stack size or superior pruning in SICStus.
